<p class="lead">
  Back in April 2012 I started working on a fullscreen JavaScript slider called <a href="http://nicinabox.github.com/superslides/">Superslides</a>. It's had some interest, so I wanted to officially announce it here.

So, yeah, it's just what it sounds like: a full screen slider (or carousel if you prefer that). I wasn't happy with the current state of fullscreen sliders. Supersized is bloated and hasn't been updated in quite a while. It was cumbersome to work with and didn't fit my needs, so I began work on this project. It's light (only 4kb) and easy to use. Check of the documentation on Github.

One of my goals for this project is that it stays light on features. There's not something for everyone. It's horizontal slider and its fullscreen. Instead, I gave a lot of attention to performance and control. It's got support for hardware acceleration in lacking browsers and a sweet API that you can hook in to.

I've learned a lot about JavaScript on this project. When I find something that could make the code clearer or the API easier to use, I'll release and update. I regularly maintain it and respond to issues on [Github](https://github.com/nicinabox/superslides).

If you've used it or want to give feedback (please do!), suggest a feature, note a bug, or whatehaveyou, just post an issue on Github.

Enjoy!
