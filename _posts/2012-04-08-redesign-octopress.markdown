I've been meaning to restyle my Octopress to get away from the default theme. Not that there's anything wrong with the default theme, it's just, well, default.

I scraped pretty much all of the original styles, but retained things like code formatting. I updated the compass config to my new stylesheets directory and pulled included the necessary support files there.

Overall, I'm happy with it. Now that I've got it to a good, slimmed down starting point it will be easier to make changes to the layout.
